['ant', 'bear', 'caterpillar'].pop.size

# What is the return value of the following statement? Why?

=begin

`pop` returns the last value in the array which would be the string
"caterpillar" and .size applies to the method to provide us with the 
number of characters in the string. So, it would be 11. 
=end
